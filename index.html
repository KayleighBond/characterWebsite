      A square yellow sponge named SpongeBob SquarePants lives in a pineapple with his pet snail,
       Gary, in the city of Bikini Bottom on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. He works as a fry
       cook at the Krusty Krab. During his time off, SpongeBob has a knack for attracting trouble
        with his starfish best friend, Patrick. Arrogant octopus Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob's
        neighbor, dislikes SpongeBob because of his childlike behavior.
